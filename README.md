## IMPACT OF TORNADOS, HEAT ETC. ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE US ECONOMY
Which event types (tornados, floods, heat etc.) are most harmful in respect to public health and the US economy?

## SYNOPSIS 
To discuss the above, we use the events from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage. The dataset used here starts in the year 1950 and ends in November 2011.

The two main questions are: 
1. Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?
2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

To answer the first question in detail, we encourage you to check HARMFUL EVENTS BY INJURIES, FATALITIES. And following THE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY you will get a detailed answer to the second.

The [PA2_NOAA_Storm.md](PA2_NOAA_Storm.md) file contains all the necessary code and explains it on the go  (=literate programming).
